3D organ growth tracking with minimum segmentation
=====
Prerequisites
------
In the standard mode, we use 3D-NOD framework as the pre-trained network and apply it as a new organ detection module. For details on its specific implementation, please refer to https://github.com/zingersu/3D-New-Organ-Detection-in-Plant-Growth-from-Spatiotemporal-Point-Clouds
The code only has a pytorch version now, and its corresponding configurations are as follows:<br>
* All deep networks run under Ubuntu 18.04<br>
* Tensorflow version:<br>
    * Python == 3.16.3<br>
    * Tensorflow == 1.13.1<br>
    * CUDA == 10.0<br>
