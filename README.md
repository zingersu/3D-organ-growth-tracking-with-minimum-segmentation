3D organ growth tracking with minimum segmentation
=====
Prerequisites
------
In the standard mode, we use 3D-NOD framework as the pre-trained network and apply it as a new organ detection module. For details on its specific implementation, please refer to https://github.com/zingersu/3D-New-Organ-Detection-in-Plant-Growth-from-Spatiotemporal-Point-Clouds
After identifying new and old organs, all codes run under the pytorch version, and its corresponding configurations are as follows:<br>
* The 3D-OGT framework runs under Windows 11<br>
* Current code execution environment:<br>
    * Python == 3.8.20<br>
    * Pytorch == 2.1.2<br>
    * CUDA == 12.1<br>
    * Pandas == 2.0.3<br>
    * Scikit-learn == 1.3.2<br>
